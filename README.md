## Perceiver AR - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07765">Perceiver AR</a>, Deepmind's new long-context attention network based on Perceiver architecture, in Pytorch.

<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/perceiver-ar/index.html">Generated piano samples</a>

I am building this out of popular demand, not because I believe in the architecture. As someone else puts it succinctly, this is equivalent to an encoder / decoder transformer architecture where the encoder has 0 layers (and the decoder cross attention is restricted to 1 layer)

However, the experimental results they provided are still worthwhile and I'll build it out so students and researchers alike can explore along this avenue.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install perceiver-ar-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from perceiver_ar_pytorch import PerceiverAR

model = PerceiverAR(
    num_tokens = 20000,             # number of tokens
    dim = 512,                      # model dimensions
    depth = 8,                      # model depth
    dim_head = 64,                  # attention head dimension
    heads = 8,                      # attention heads
    max_seq_len = 4096,             # total max sequence length
    cross_attn_seq_len = 3072,      # the sequence length in which to attend to, but does not undergo self attention (must be less than max_seq_len)
)

x = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 4096))

logits = model(x) # (1, 1024, 20000) - (4096 [seq len] - 3072 [perceived prefix] == 1024)
```
